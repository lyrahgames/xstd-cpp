# xstd - C++ Extensions and Utilities

`xstd` is a C++ utility library that extends the STL with practical helpers and ergonomic abstractions to reduce boilerplate and speed up application prototyping.
It is designed to feel like a natural extension of the standard library
while staying simple, explicit, and easy to adopt.

## Requirements and Dependencies

`xstd` uses the [standard `build2` CI service][ci.cppget.org] to build and test its source code with a [variety of build configurations][ci.cppget.org-build-configs].
For a thorough list of requirements, see the [`manifest`][manifest] file.
To see detailed information about the current build status, [set up `xstd` for development and run `bdep ci`](#how-to-set-up-xstd-for-development).
<!-- To see the build status of already published package versions, see [the package's build status report]. -->

`xstd` deliberately targets the newest C++ language standards and makes extensive use of recently standardized features.
As such, it requires a modern C++ compiler with strong support for the latest standards (typically recent versions of Clang or GCC).

<!-- Here is a short list of essential requirements and dependencies: -->

<!-- **Architecture:** -->
<!-- - `x86_64` | `aarch64` -->

<!-- **Operating System:** -->
<!-- - Linux | MacOS | Windows -->

<!-- **C++ Compiler:** -->
<!-- - GCC 14 | Clang 18 -->
<!-- | MinGW | MSVC | Emscripten -->
<!-- - `libstdc++` | `libc++` -->

<!-- **Build Toolchain:** -->
<!-- - [`build2`][build2] -->

<!-- **Automatically handled Dependencies:** -->
<!-- **Manually handled Requirements:** -->

<!-- ## Introduction -->

## Getting Started

`xstd` relies on [the `build2` toolchain][build2] for building and
dependency management.
Install it via your system's package manager or follow the instructions in [The `build2` Installation Manual][build2-install] to build it from source.
If you are new to `build2`, see [The `build2` Toolchain Introduction][build2-intro] and [The `build2` Build System Manual][build2-build-system] for more information.

### Usage in `build2`-Based Projects

1. Add this repository to the `repositories.manifest` of your `build2` project. To track the latest development version, append `#main` to the repository
location.

```
:
role: prerequisite
location: https://github.com/lyrahgames/xstd-cpp.git
```

2. In the `manifest` file of each `build2` package that requires it, declare a dependency on `libxstd`. An [optional version constraint](https://build2.org/bpkg/doc/build2-package-manager-manual.xhtml#package-version-constraint) may be specified.

```
depends: libxstd == 0.1.0
```

3. In every `buildfile` that defines targets depending on `xstd`, import the library and add it as dependency.

```
import xstd = libxstd%lib{xstd}
exe{myexe}: {hxx cxx}{**} $xstd
```

## Configuration

Currently, `xstd` does not expose any public configuration options.

## Documentation

This `README.md` currently contains all project documentation.
Additional documentation may be added in the future as the project evolves.

### Usage, Examples, and Tutorials

No usage examples or tutorials are currently provided.
They will be added as the library matures.

### FAQs and HOWTOs

#### How to install or use `xstd` in projects not based on `build2`?

You can make a `build2` package available for non-`build2` projects by following these essential steps.
For more information, consult [The `build2` Toolchain Introduction: Package Consumption][build2-intro-consumption] and [The `build2` Toolchain Introduction: Using Unpackaged Dependencies][build2-intro-unpackaged-dependencies].

1. Create a build configuration for C/C++-based `build2` packages.

```
bpkg create -d build2-packages cc \
  config.cxx=g++ \
  config.cc.coptions="-O3 -march=native" \
  config.install.root=/usr/local \
  config.install.sudo=sudo
```

2. Fetch the repository's packages and build them.

```
bpkg build https://github.com/lyrahgames/xstd-cpp.git
```

3. Install the built package.

```
bpkg install libxstd
```

4. Optionally, uninstall the built packages when you do not need them any longer.

```
bpkg uninstall libxstd
```

5. To upgrade the package, fetch all new information and uninstall the older version. Afterwards, build the new version and install it.

```
bpkg fetch
bpkg status

bpkg uninstall libxstd
bpkg build libxstd
bpkg install libxstd
```

#### How to set up `xstd` for development?

These steps prepare the repository for development.
Familiarity with `build2` is recommended.
For full details, see [The `build2` Toolchain Introduction][build2-intro].

1. Clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/lyrahgames/xstd-cpp.git
cd xstd-cpp
```

2. Use `bdep` to create the initial build configuration. If not stated otherwise, it will be placed within the previously created project-specific directory. For example, the command below shows how to create and initialize a configuration named `gcc-release` with installation and distribution support.

```
bdep init -C @gcc-release cc \
  config.cxx=g++ \
  config.cxx.coptions="-O3 -march=native" \
  config.install.root=../.install \
  config.dist.root=../.dist
```

3. Common Development Tasks

  + Use `bdep` to print the status of project packages and their immediate dependencies.

```
bdep status -i
```

  + Use `b` to build and test the source code.

```
b                      # Build all the code.
b test                 # Only build and run the tests.
b {clean update}       # Clean build all the code.
b {clean update test}  # Clean build all the code and run the tests.
```

  + Similarly, to build and test the source in a specific build configuration with `bdep`, run the following commands.

```
bdep update @gcc-release
bdep test @gcc-release
bdep clean @gcc-release
```

  + Use `b` to test the installation of the project. In the example configuration `gcc-release` created above, the installation directory `.install` is part of the development folder.

```
b install
b uninstall
```

  + Use `b` to test the distribution of the project's packages. In the example configuration `gcc-release` created above, the directory for distributions `.dist` is part of the development folder.

```
b dist: libxstd
```

  + After thoroughly testing the aforementioned steps, make a commit and leverage [`build2`'s standard CI service][ci.cppget.org] to simultaneously build and test the project across a [range of build configurations][ci.cppget.org-build-configs].

```
bdep ci
```
